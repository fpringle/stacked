- fix some drawing bugs e.g. loading a level while a level is already loading
- credits (similar to level picker, go to X to click link
- remember user-defined commands, give the option to paste them into the editor
- sounds
- exit conditions - stack has to look a certain way?
- obstacles that push to or pop from the stack
- do something cooler on "finish" button
- custom errors
- add indicator above the editor to display the current # of comands? could be like code golf...
