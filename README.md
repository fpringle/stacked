# Stacked
Browser-based programming game written in JavaScript

## Credits

For the concept and implementation of this project I drew inspiration heavily from 
[Untrusted](https://github.com/AlexNisnevich/untrusted) by
[Alex Nisnevich](http://alex.nisnevich.com/) and
[Greg Shuflin](https://github.com/neunenak). Go check out their game; it's better
written, more addictive and far more educational!

Stacked uses [CodeMirror](https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror) for the editor,
[rot.js](https://github.com/ondras/rot.js) for the map display, and
[clipboard.js](https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js) for
clipboard access.
